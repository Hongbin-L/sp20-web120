           <h2>Responsive vs Mobile</h2>
           <p>    Mobile apps are the norm for every company in the modern world because they are very convenient.
 Kris report that:
Most businesses need, and already have, mobile-optimized pages these days. And while native apps generally perform more efficiently, not every business needs one to be successful. If cost is an issue, businesses can leverage their web platforms to feature as many mobile benefits as possible to avoid the financial investments of a native app. (Kris)
But make no mistake, mobile apps can be powerful for brand awareness, marketing, and creating a quality user experience. Examine your budget and your businessâ€™s goals to determine whether the investment in mobile app infrastructure will pay off in the long run. (Kris)

            <p>     Responsive websites face all devices that have access to the Internet, but mobile apps face smartphones and tablets.
Korol report that:
A mobile app is not always better than the mobile version of the site and vice versa. To choose one of them you must understand the purpose of the product: who will use it and how often. Also one should know, what is more important: higher performance and functionality or the product development price. From the point of view of money saving, web development is a better option. In this case, the content is more important than the visual expression of the app. The mobile app is likely more preferable to a responsive mobile website if your plans require high performance. In addition, the offline/online availability is an essential issue. Mobile applications do not depend on the Internet access as responsive websites so that many operations can be performed in the offline mode. Of course, there is no clear answer to what business needs: a mobile site or a mobile application. The main thing is to think about your clients as users of mobile devices and make their life as comfortable as possible. And after all, who said, you have to choose only one option? There are plenty of people who decided not to limit their business to only one form of representation! You can become one of them.(Korol)
