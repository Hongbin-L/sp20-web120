           <h2>Monetizing Websites</h2>
           <p> Monetizing the website is the basic revenue that keeps our website running. There are many ways to monetize our website. Schaferhoff point out ten ways to monetize the website:
1. Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing is one of the most popular (not to mention quickest) ways to make money from your website or blog.
2. “Pay Per Click” advertising
AdWords are the advertisements that show up on the top of Google search result pages. AdSense is the reverse, allowing publishers to tap into Google’s immense advertising network so that other advertisers can run ads on their website.
3.Sell ad space
Incorporating Google’s AdSense on your website is just one way to make money from online advertisements.
4. Sell your own digital product
You have the potential to make the most money on a per-sale basis when you can sell your own directly. That’s because there’s no middle-man or person in between you and the buyer that’s taking a ‘cut’ from the money earned.
5. Accept donations from visitors
Accepting one-off donations isn’t a fast road to wealth, but it can help you cover expenses in the short-term if people like what you have to say and want to support your journey.
6. Sell sponsored posts
One of the common ways to make more money from your website means getting those visitor numbers UP. Once you’ve done the hard work of building steady traffic to your site with an engaged community, there are a few different ways to monetize your hard work.
7. Generate ‘leads’ for other companies
Businesses thrive on new leads coming in their doors to inquire about their products or services. It’s no surprise that they’re always on the lookout, searching for creative ways to find new sources of leads to help them grow.
8. Build an ‘Email List’
Spend any amount of time reading blog growth tips, and you’re sure to come across people saying “the money’s in the list“. They’re referring to your email list, which comprises your most loyal readers. The objective is to convert as many strangers who visit your site for the first time into passionate followers who want to stay up-to-date on your latest work or content.
9. Set up an eCommerce site
Websites don’t just have to be about content. They can be centered around tools or products on an online store.
10. Flip your websites
Believe it or not, there’s almost always a market out there for your website. That means if you’ve built up a following (or possibly even sold a few products or included advertising on your site), you might be able to sell it to someone else and make a quick buck.

            <p>Create an online shopping cart can make transactions easier and safer. I research an article from the website Network Solutions:
	“Ecommerce is more than just buying and selling. It's the ability to accept payments, manage inventory, and create the actual shopping environment your customers will use. A Web services company with ecommerce expertise will help you set-up your site. Unlike an online auction site like eBay, an ecommerce website means customers pay the price you set. It also means you can easily change pricing and offer promotions and discounts.”(Building an Ecommerce Website, par. 2)<br/></p>
